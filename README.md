# Predicting Handwritten Digits with Neural Network: MNIST Dataset Exploration
This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on predicting handwritten digits using a neural network. The project explores the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of handwritten digit images.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The project explores the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used for digit recognition tasks. By training a neural network on this dataset, we aim to achieve high accuracy in identifying handwritten digits.


# Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy


# Contents
The repository includes the following files and directories:

- data/: This directory contains the MNIST dataset, which is divided into training and testing sets. It is preprocessed and ready for training the model.

- notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks provide detailed explanations and insights into the different stages of the project.

- models/: This directory holds the saved trained models for digit recognition. You can load these models to make predictions on new or unseen handwritten digit images.

- utils/: This directory includes utility functions and helper scripts used in the project, such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.

- requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python libraries and their versions to replicate the project environment.
